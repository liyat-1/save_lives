# GoFundMe Clone


## Description


I have completed a MERN stack project where I created a platform similar to GoFundMe, but specifically for individuals or patients who are unable to afford their medical expenses. This project was inspired by the difficulties faced by many people in Ethiopia who have to resort to collecting money on the streets to pay for medical care. Through my platform, users can log in to my platform and post their medical expenses along with an approval letter from the hospital.  The project was built using React and Bootstrap for the frontend, and Node.js/Express for the backend, with a MongoDB database. In developing my project, I leveraged several React.js technologies and libraries, including React functional components, react-router-dom for navigation, and React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useRef to manage the application state, route protection. To fetch data from the Node.js/Express API, I used axios, and to ensure secure authentication, I implemented jwt-tokens. For the backend of my application, I developed a RESTful API using Express.js and implemented jwt-tokens to ensure secure authentication and authorization. To handle requests before they are processed by the server, I utilized middleware functions. Additionally, I integrated my Express.js backend with a MongoDB database to store and manage data for the application.
